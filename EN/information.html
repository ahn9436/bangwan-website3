            <p class="grid-paragraph">The story begins with "Grandfather Yom Dueng," who took his cattle to sell in Takola, which is now known as Takua Pa.

                While passing through the Kuraburi area, one of his cattle became ill and started vomiting. Because of this, the place was later named "Kuraburi District," a name that remains to this day.
                
                However, upon reaching Ban Kurodd, the cattle miraculously recovered from its illness. This led to the village being called "Ban Kurodd," a name that has been preserved to this day.</p>

            <p class="grid-paragraph">Kurod Village is a community renowned for its agriculture and gardening,
                 which are the primary occupations of the local residents. Most of the villagers' income comes from farming and gardening,
                  such as cultivating oil palm and rubber trees, which serve as important sources of revenue. This reflects the simplicity and deep connection with nature that characterizes this community.
                 Additionally, the village is blessed with a rich and abundant sea, enabling residents to also engage in marine-based occupations.
