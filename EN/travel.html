            <p class="grid-item-text">This Southern-style Kanom Jeen (fermented rice noodle) restaurant is a hidden gem. If you visit once, you’ll surely fall in love. The restaurant is located right next to a stream, with water flowing by at all times.

                You can enjoy a buffet of delicious Kanom Jeen for less than 100 baht, while also having plenty of great photo opportunities. There are also a variety of single dishes to choose from.
                
                What makes this place even more special is that you can take your Kanom Jeen and enjoy it while sitting in the stream itself! It's an unforgettable dining experience you won’t find anywhere else.</p>

                <img src="/images/bird.png" alt="image of bird" class="grid-image">
            </div>
            <p class="grid-item-text">In reality, this place wasn’t originally a bird garden. Uncle Wat, the owner, simply had a passion for collecting and planting various types of trees in his mixed forest garden.

                Over time, he noticed that every morning and evening, many different bird species would fly down from the mountains to drink water and feast on the fruits he had planted.
                
                Seeing this, Uncle Wat decided to open his garden to visitors, students, and photographers, allowing them to enjoy both the beauty of his garden and the sight of these birds in their natural habitat.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="grid-item-text">This market is well-known among the locals of Kuraburi. Though not very large, it is packed with delicious food options.

                Every morning, a famous fish porridge stall draws crowds—if you arrive even a little late, you might miss out! But it's not just the fish porridge that makes this market special. The grilled pork skewers, Chinese donuts (Pa Thong Ko), and traditional coffee are all just as tempting.
                
                On certain days, the market also hosts a special fair, making it even more exciting. Once you experience it, you’ll surely be coming back for more!</p>
